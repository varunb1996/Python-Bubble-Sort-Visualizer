Consider a telephone directory containing phone numbers in random order. Since the listing is random, finding specific information is going to be time-consuming and laborious. The same task can be easy to perform when the directory is alphabetically ordered. This is where Sorting comes to play. Sorting is a technique that aids searching for necessary information by ordering elements of consideration in increasing the order of numbers or alphabets.

The objective of this project is to create bubble sort visualizer using pygame.
